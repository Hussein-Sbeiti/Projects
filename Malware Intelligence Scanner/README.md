# 🛡️ VirusTotal Hash Scanner

A lightweight Python script to scan SHA-256 hashes using the [VirusTotal API](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference). This tool reads hashes from a file, queries VirusTotal for each one, and logs detection results in a CSV file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Reads SHA-256 hashes from a `.txt` file
- Queries each hash using the VirusTotal v3 API
- Extracts detection stats, reputation score, and verdict
- Marks whether the file is malicious or not
- Saves all results in a clean `vt_results.csv`

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` module  
Install with:

```bash
pip install requests


📊 Output

Results are saved to vt_results.csv with columns:
	•	hash
	•	malicious (number of engines that flagged it)
	•	total (number of engines that scanned it)
	•	reputation (VT reputation score)
	•	is_malicious (“Yes” if flagged, otherwise “No”)
	•	error (only shown if lookup failed)

⸻

📌 Notes
	•	Free VirusTotal API keys are rate-limited to 4 requests/minute
	•	Use time.sleep(15) to stay under that limit
	•	You can upgrade to a premium key for faster bulk analysis
