Credit Card Fraud Detection and Analysis

This project uses a credit card fraud detection dataset to implement various machine learning techniques for data preprocessing, classification, and clustering. The goal is to identify and analyze fraudulent transactions effectively.

Features and Steps in the Notebook
	1.	Introduction
	•	Overview of the fraud detection problem and the approach taken.
	2.	Library Imports
	•	Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib are used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
	3.	Utility Functions
	•	Functions for file handling, data preprocessing, and utility tasks:
	•	File Finder: Locates and reads CSV files by name.
	•	Data Preprocessor: Cleans and preprocesses datasets, including handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical variables.
	4.	Modeling Functions
	•	Functions to define, train, and evaluate machine learning models:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Random Forest
	•	Decision Trees
	•	Clustering models like K-Means and DBSCAN
	5.	Metrics and Evaluation
	•	The models are evaluated using:
	•	Classification reports
	•	ROC-AUC curves
	•	Confusion matrices
	6.	Visualization
	•	Use of plots to visualize performance metrics and clustering results.

Installation

To run this notebook, install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Usage
	1.	Place the dataset (CSV file) in the working directory or specify its location.
	2.	Update the notebook to load your dataset by modifying the find_csv_file() function.
	3.	Run the notebook step-by-step:
	•	Preprocess the data.
	•	Train and evaluate different models.
	•	Analyze and visualize results.

Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:
	•	Handling missing values (numeric with median, categorical with placeholders).
	•	Dropping columns with high cardinality.
	•	One-hot encoding categorical variables.
	•	Splitting data into training and test sets.

Outputs
	•	Model performance metrics.
	•	Plots of evaluation metrics and clustering results.
	•	Insights into the best-performing models and their effectiveness in fraud detection.
