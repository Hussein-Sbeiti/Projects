This project analyzes UEFA Champions League matches to build a predictive regression model for estimating the score difference between home and away teams. Using a dataset obtained through the Football Data API, the project leverages team performance metrics, referee assignments, and match-related features to uncover insights into match outcomes. The linear regression algorithm is used to create the model, aiming to provide fans, analysts, and broadcasters with data-driven predictions and deeper understanding of match dynamics. This project not only enhances fan engagement but also demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in sports analytics. Explore the code, data, and insights in this repository to see how machine learning can bring value to the beautiful game!
